# javascript-challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
This javascript code allows you to look at all UFO data provided from different locations and gives the user the ability to filter, by date, through all the UFO sighting information.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created an HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Use a date form in HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
